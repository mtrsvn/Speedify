# Speedify
Just a little project I came up with because I was being bored. It's an easy download speed test that allows you to test your internet connection's download speed in a quick and easy way. Nothing too extravagant, just a utility to determine if your internet is working as it should. Feel free to take a look, and perhaps it'll time you a bit when you're wondering why your download takes so long.
